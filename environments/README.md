# Environment Configurations

## Overview
This directory contains environment-specific Terraform configurations for different deployment stages (dev, staging, prod) of the pharmaceutical infrastructure.

## Environment Structure

### Development (`dev/`)
- Development environment configuration
- Test infrastructure setup
- Development-specific variables
- Local testing configurations

### Staging (`staging/`)
- Pre-production environment
- Integration testing setup
- Performance testing configuration
- Staging-specific variables

### Production (`prod/`)
- Production environment
- High availability setup
- Disaster recovery configuration
- Production-specific variables

## Environment Configuration

### Variable Files
- `terraform.tfvars` - Environment-specific values
- `variables.tf` - Variable definitions
- `versions.tf` - Provider and module versions

### State Management
- Remote state configuration
- State file encryption
- State locking
- Backup procedures

## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. AWS account access
2. Required IAM permissions
3. Terraform installed
4. AWS CLI configured

### Configuration Steps
1. Select environment directory
2. Update variables
3. Initialize Terraform
4. Apply configuration

## Environment Management

### Deployment Process
1. Development testing
2. Staging validation
3. Production deployment
4. Post-deployment verification

### Maintenance
- Regular updates
- Security patches
- Performance optimization
- Cost optimization

## Security

### Access Control
- Environment-specific IAM roles
- Network security groups
- VPC configurations
- Security policies

### Compliance

- Log groups
- Alarms
- Dashboards

### Cost Management
- Resource tagging
- Cost allocation
- Budget alerts
- Usage monitoring

## Backup and Recovery

### State Backup
- Regular backups

### Disaster Recovery
- Recovery procedures
- Backup verification
- State restoration
- Service recovery

## Environment-Specific Considerations

### Development
- Quick iteration
- Cost optimization
- Development tools
