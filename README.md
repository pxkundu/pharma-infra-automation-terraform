Specify security needs (e.g., IAM roles for EKS, pod-level permissions).
Define networking requirements (e.g., VPC with private subnets, VPC endpoints for S3).
Document compliance needs (e.g., HIPAA audit logging, GDPR data isolation).
Create JIRA epics: “EKS Cluster Setup,” “Microservices Deployment,” “Security Automation,” “Networking Configuration,” “Compliance Framework.”
Dependency Mapping:
Map module dependencies:
VPC → Subnets → Security Groups → EKS Cluster.
IAM roles → EKS node groups and pod service accounts.
S3 (for Helm charts) → EKS workloads.
CloudTrail → Compliance auditing.
Document dependency graph in Confluence (e.g., VPC → EKS → Ingress Controller).
Define module inputs/outputs (e.g., cluster_endpoint output from EKS module).
Plan provider dependencies (e.g., AWS provider, Kubernetes provider, Helm provider).
Terraform Structure Design:
Plan directory structure:
modules/: EKS, VPC, IAM, KMS, S3, CloudTrail, AWS Config.
environments/: dev, staging, prod.
global/: backend, shared IAM policies.
Define naming conventions (e.g., ${var.environment}-eks-cluster).
Plan state file segmentation (per environment) to minimize blast radius.
Lifecycle Management Setup:
Configure S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for Terraform state (encrypted with KMS).
Set up GitLab repositories with branch protection (main for prod, feature branches for dev/staging).
Plan module versioning (e.g., v1.0.0 tags in GitLab).
Design CI/CD pipeline stages: init, validate, plan, test (Terratest), approve, apply.
Compliance Planning:
Map HIPAA/GDPR requirements to EKS configurations (e.g., encrypted EBS volumes, pod security policies).
